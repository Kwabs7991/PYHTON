#Tuples:

#Can be thought of as immutable lists. Once you create it, it is how it is. you cannot change, or sort it, reverse it, etc.

##These are helpful as it tells other programmers, that it should not be changed 

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5,5,6,5)

print(my_tuple)
print(5 in my_tuple)

print(my_tuple.count(5))
print(my_tuple.index(3))
print(len(my_tuple))


print('\n\n\n\n')
#Sets: are unordered collection of unique objects.

my_sets = {1,2,3,4,5}
print(my_sets)


my_dos_set = {1,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5}
print(my_dos_set)

#values ina set need to be unique.So when i try and add the two values, 100 and 3 as seen belwo, we will see that 100 will be added because there is no value of 100 in the set but 3 is already in the set so the additional 3 will not be added. VALUES MUST BE UNIQUE. so when we print they will only appear once.my_dos_set

my_dos_set.add(100)
my_dos_set.add(3)
my_dos_set.add(9876)
my_dos_set.add(7)
print(my_dos_set)
print('\n\n\n')
##Coding Exercise:
print('Coding Exercise -list to set: \n')
###Return the array below with no duplicates. simple:
print('list:')
dupThisList = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,9,6,6,6,4,5,5,5,5]
print(dupThisList)
print('\nset:')
print(set(dupThisList))
print(len(dupThisList))
print(8 in dupThisList)
